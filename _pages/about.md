I am a second year PhD  student in Formal Linguistics at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/traduccio), where I am advised by [Louise McNally](https://www.upf.edu/web/mcnally), and a member of [GLiF](https://www.upf.edu/web/glif). In my PhD thesis, I explore the semantics of words that are derived from proper names from formal and probabilistic perspectives. Specifically, I deal with the problem of developing a semantic account that explains how the integration of the information from the proper name and the information from morphology is achieved when a word of this kind is derived. 

My research interests lie in the interface between philosophy and linguistics. In Bogotá, I did a B.A. in Philosophy (2017), a B.A. in Linguistics (2019) and a M.A. in Philosophy (2022). In my [M.A.  thesis](https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/81311), I explored the nature of spatial concepts (a problem from the philosophy of mind) using semantic descriptions of spatial terms as a tool to carry out the conceptual analysis. In Barcelona, I studied a M.A. in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics (2023). In my [second M.A. thesis](https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/58002), I started approaching  the semantics of words derived from proper names and the problems that come with it. Some of these problems are different instantiations of the traditional issues (well known by philosophers and linguists) concerning the content of proper names.

- _October, 2024._ On the 21st of this month, I will start a two-month research stay at the [Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle](http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/en) ([Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr)), where I will work under the supervision of [Olivier Bonami](http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/fr/Gens/Bonami). The purpose of this stay is to advance in the analysis of the morphological properties of words derived from proper names. 
- _October, 2024._ I have started the second year of my PhD. The goals for this year are: to complete the corpus study of words derived from proper names that I started in the first year, to formulate hypotheses about the semantic and morphological properties of these words, and to test these hypotheses by means of experiments.
- _September, 2024._ Nuo Xu and I have taken on the task of running the organization of the [GLiF](https://www.upf.edu/web/glif) seminars (a task we will be undertaking throughout this year). I am excited to work hand in hand with Nuo and to contribute to my research group in carrying out this task.
- _August, 2024_. I participated in the [35th European Summer School on Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)](https://2024.esslli.eu). I was delighted to learn about very interesting developments in formal linguistics and to engage in dialogue with inspiring scholars.
